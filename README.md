# dotfiles

This repository contains the dotfiles customizations I use in terminal environments. It includes configurations for:
1. prezto
2. powerlevel10k
3. zsh
4. vim
5. tmux


full disclosure - I haven't looked at this in a while, and I need to update (really, revisit and recreate) the instructions here.

So, this will change over time.
